# Bug: Cards don't flip on mobile tap (Chrome)

## Description
After refreshing the page on Chrome mobile, tapping on cards does not trigger the flip animation. The cards remain static and unresponsive to touch input.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the game on Chrome mobile browser
2. Refresh the page
3. Tap on any card
4. Expected: Card should flip to reveal the image
5. Actual: Card does not respond to tap

## Environment
- **Browser**: Chrome (Mobile)
- **Device**: Mobile device (smartphone/tablet)
- **Branch**: `claude/code-refactoring-011CUM1GUvU6TimzTBibuMCs`
- **Commit**: `8efe086`

## Suspected Causes
- Event delegation using `click` events may not work properly on mobile
- Touch events (`touchstart`, `touchend`) may be needed in addition to click events
- Module initialization timing may be causing issues on mobile
- The `closest()` selector in event delegation might have issues on mobile browsers

## Impact
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Affects**: All mobile users
- **Workaround**: None currently available

- `src/main.js` - Game initialization
- `index.html` and `page-2.html` - Module loading

## Technical Details

Current event handling code:
```javascript
// src/MemoryGame.js:51-57
this.cardsContainer.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  const card = event.target.closest('.game__card');

  if (card && this.canFlipCard(card)) {
    this.flip(card);
  }
});
```

This code only listens for `click` events, which may not fire reliably on mobile devices with touch input.

## Investigation Completed ✅

Root cause identified:
1. SVG elements inside cards were capturing touch events on mobile
2. Only `click` events were being handled, not `touchend` events
3. Event bubbling from SVG children was not reliable on mobile Chrome

## Fix Applied ✅

### Changes Made:

#### 1. CSS Fix (style.css:161-169)
Added `pointer-events: none` to SVG and image elements:
```css
.game__back-card svg,
.game__back-card svg *,
.game__front-card img {
  pointer-events: none;
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
  -webkit-touch-callout: none;
}
```

#### 2. JavaScript Fix (src/MemoryGame.js:44-97)
- Added `touchend` event listener alongside `click` events
- Implemented touch/click debouncing to prevent double-firing
- Added `event.preventDefault()` for touch events

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test on Chrome Mobile (Android)
- [ ] Test on Chrome Mobile (iOS)
- [ ] Test on Firefox Mobile
- [ ] Test desktop still works
- [ ] Test with touch screen laptop
- [ ] Verify no double-firing of events
- [ ] Check console for errors

## Priority
**HIGH** - Breaks core functionality on mobile devices (FIXED)
